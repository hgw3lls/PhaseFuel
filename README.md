# PhaseFuel

PhaseFuel is now a Vite + React single-page app that runs entirely in the browser. It calls the OpenAI API directly and stores plans locally in `localStorage` by user ID.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local URL shown in your terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
